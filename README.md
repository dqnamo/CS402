## Assignment Descriptions
### Assignment Six - Sockets Client Server Currency Conversion
Create a Java socket based client-server style application where the server implements an
executor service with a threadpool for executing incoming requests. The service doesn't have
to do anything significant, for example a simple calculation of some kind would suffice. The
server should print out details of incoming client connections as well as returning results to
the client.
